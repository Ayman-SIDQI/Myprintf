ft_printf - 42 Network Project

As part of my work within the 42 Network, I had the opportunity to work on a project called ft_printf. The goal of this project was to create our own version of the C programming language's printf function, using only the standard C library functions.

After a couple of months of learning how to program, I felt confident enough to take on this challenge. I started by researching the functionality and syntax of the existing printf function, studying its documentation and analyzing examples to gain a deep understanding of how it worked.

## The Process

I began designing my own implementation, creating a basic skeleton function that could accept a format string and a variable number of arguments. From there, I added logic to parse the format string and extract the appropriate arguments.

As I encountered new formatting options, I added them to my function, thoroughly testing each addition to ensure that it worked as expected.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was handling the various data types that printf could receive as arguments. I had to develop a system to recognize and handle all of the different types, including integers, floats, and strings, while also properly formatting them according to the provided format string.

## Conclusion

In the end, I was proud of the work I had done on ft_printf. It was a challenging project that required a lot of effort and dedication, but it also taught me a lot about programming and problem-solving. I feel that this project helped me to improve my skills and become a better developer.
